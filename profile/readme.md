# Theme 6: Phenotyping Perception beyond 2D Colour

## The Challenge (Choose 1 of 2 subthemes)

### Subtheme 3D skeletonisation: 

Accurate skeletonisation of 3D plants is crucial to determine the architecture of plants.

This architecture is important to reduce the reality gap of 3D functional structural plant models and real plants. In this sub challenge teams will receive a dataset of 44 segmented tomato plants, including ground truth skeletons. The main challenge is to develop an algorithm to correctly extract the nodes of these plant as accurate as possible. An example point cloud is shown below, in which the colours represent the classes: leaves, main stem, side stem and pole. The second image shows the output of the ground truth skeletonisation.

On top of this you will gain experience in working with 3D data to be able to use the provided framework for your custom dataset.

### Subtheme Hyperspectral Strawberry Brix estimation:

In the realm of precision agriculture, hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for non-destructive assessment of crop characteristics. 

This theme focuses on utilising regression analysis in hyperspectral imaging to predict the brix values (sugar content) of strawberries across various species and maturity stages. Brix values are currently generated with a destructive process that is not sustainable, thus, by employing advanced Machine and Deep learning techniques, you will develop robust models capable of accurately estimating brix values based on spectral data. You will also be encouraged to utilise eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methodologies where appropriate to create human-interpretable explanations for models. A baseline using partial least squares with a developed pipeline is available for further exploration of the large dataset supplied.

To give a visual idea of what hyperspectral data can look like please see the image below.
